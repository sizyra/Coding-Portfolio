            Welcome to the About page! While this entire portfolio is about me, this part is especially self-serving. Here I'll be talking about my hobbies, interests, and personal life a bit. This is partly to show you who am I when not working on specific assignments, but also serves as the best introduction I can give in the middle of a global pandemic.<br><br>For starters, I'm 26. I was born in West Lafayette, Indiana, moved to Maryland when I was 6 months old, mvoed to Norman, Oklahoma when I was 4, moved to <em>Bloomgtinon</em>, Indiana at 14, and just moved to Beaverton, Oregon last month. For the more fun stuff, keep reading - pleased to meet you!

            A lot of my free time is spent either writing, gaming, or both. I've been writing poetry and prose since late middle school, and I've been telling myself complex and strange stories for as long as I can remember. When I give my brain a break and choose to play video games, it's often a narratively-captivating role-playing game like <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> or something creative and relaxing like <em>Minecraft</em>.

            Alongside hobbies, I have a number of interests that I enjoy from afar. For starters, I'm a <em>massive</em> Star Wars fan. I own over 120 Star Wars novels and have read each of them at least twice, though some are probably in the double-digits. I love sci-fi movies as a rule, sweeping orchestral music, and comedies galore. Add those all together and you get someone who thinks Firefly should've gotten 10 seasons.

            Joining me for most of these activities is my wife, Braden, and our two cats, Millie (black and white) and Momo (orange). B is an elementary school teacher who's currently Zoom-tutoring. Neither cat is employed and they don't care. Millie doesn't feel bad because she's a spoiled little princess. Momo doesn't feel bad because he's a just a bit dumb.
