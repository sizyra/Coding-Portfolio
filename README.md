The navbar on each page is fully functional and identical. It contains:
- A home page (index.html)
- An About page (about.html)
- A Portfolio page (portfolio.html)
- A Contact page (contact.html)
- My up-to-date Resume which opens as a PDF in a new tab

Created a separate Home Page. I felt a professional portfolio might benefit from a bit of cushioning between my personal details and the arrival screen.

Contact page is finished. Contains LinkedIn, GitHub, and Gmail links (gmail just starts writing an email to me).

About page is finished. Contains hobbies, interests, and some personal details. 

Portfolio page is finished. Since I've created no other sites so far and this portfolio focuses on coding and wed design, I included fake links and preview images.

All pages have a fixed footer and sub-rows, though no sub-columns.
